# Stroke

<h3>Technical Programming Assignment 25_10_19</h3>

As far as environment goes - this code uses standard libraries for Python3, and can be activated from the terminal/command line with the with the command: jupyter notebook. There is a requirements.txt file in the zip file.

It would also be possible to dockerise the solution if meant for collaboration/production to ensure portability. This method provides all the necessary requirements within a pipfile or equivalent.

<b>There are 3 files in this repo:</b>

* requirements.txt - as noted above  

* StrokePrediction.ipynb - this file contains code for exploring the training data 'train_2v.csv' and for running predictive models on it  

* train_2v.csv - the training data noted above 

My notebook and report with commentary can be viewed here:
